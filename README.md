# Today-in-History

The main purpose of this website is for it to attract a user who has a interest in history or is drawn into the website to find out what events took place today in the past. They will then, hopefully, subscribe to our website so that they can receive newsletters every week giving them a timetable of the events that have happened and the main event the website will be covering.
Today in History Website will tell you what events happened today in the past and provide podcasts, Videos and magazine on the events that took place on this day throughout history. The example day that I am using is for the 18 June with the main event being the battle of waterloo that took place on that day. As this is the main event the user will be directed to the first image and text giving a general overview of the event. Will then provide links to see a video and a podcast relating to the main event.
There will be 3 minor events that will aslo be included that hopefully they have not encountered before and the website will provide either a podcast and a documentary video on the subject or at least a video for them to learn more. 

# UX

My goal is to design a website that provides interesting fact about events that took place without bombarding them with to much text that could result in the user getting bored.

For a casual user who enters the site for the first time i would like them to see the main event in a large photo that took place on this day and then press the read more button that will take them to the description regarding this event.
Then once they have read about the event they will have the option "for the main event" if they would like to learn more there will be buttons at the end of the article to take them to either the watch or listen sections to learn more. Hopefully they will find
the website interesting and click the subscribe button on the navbar that will remain fixed to the top.

Another experience is that someone once they are at the landing page is only intereseted in watching video about the event so will press the watch item on the navbar that will direct them to their desired destination.
But as the navbar will remain fixed and therfore follow the user they will be able to navigate to
