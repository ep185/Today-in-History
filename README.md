# Today-in-History

The main purpose of this website is for it to attract a user who has a interest in history or is drawn into the website to find out what events took place today in the past. They will then, hopefully, subscribe to our website so that they can receive newsletters every week giving them a timetable of the events that have happened and the main event the website will be covering.
Today in History Website will tell you what events happened today in the past and provide podcasts, Videos and magazine on the events that took place on this day throughout history. The example day that I am using is for the 18 June with the main event being the battle of waterloo that took place on that day. As this is the main event the user will be directed to the first image and text giving a general overview of the event. Will then provide links to see a video and a podcast relating to the main event.
There will be 3 minor events that will aslo be included that hopefully they have not encountered before and the website will provide either a podcast and a documentary video on the subject or at least a video for them to learn more. 

# UX

My goal is to design a website that provides interesting fact about events that took place without bombarding them with to much text that could result in the user getting bored.
As the user progresses down the page I want to provied the user with quick and easy way of learning about different events. First they will focus on the main event, in this case is the battle of waterloo,
and they will hopefully be drawn in by the other events which will keep their attention as the head down the page. As they reach the end of the website they will hopefully subscribe to the 
website which will provide them with daily headlines about the new content that the website will provide.

For a casual user who enters the site for the first time i would like them to see the main event in a large photo that took place on this day and then press the read more button that will take them to the description regarding this event.
Then once they have read about the event they will have the option "for the main event" if they would like to learn more there will be buttons at the end of the article to take them to either the watch or listen sections to learn more. Hopefully they will find
the website interesting and click the subscribe button on the navbar that will remain fixed to the top.

Another experience is that someone once they are at the landing page is only interested in watching video about the event so will press the watch item on the navbar that will direct them to their desired destination.
But as the navbar will remain fixed and therfore follow the user they will be able to navigate to different sections.

Want the user to be drawn in by the photos and the video's/podcasts whilst keeping the amont of text to a minimum to help the website feel less cluttered.

# Features

Will provide a fixed navbar that will provied easy navigation of the website, with a subscribe button so they can subscribe to the website at any time.
A read more button on the landing page to immediately take the use to the main event 
Buttons under each event to direct the user to the video or podcast relating to the event which will be particulary useful on the mobile.

Will show the user an image with some description describing the contents of this month's magazine (subscribe button on the navbar will provide a check box so that we can email the user about how to set up a magazine subscription)
footer that will show today in history's email contact and contact numbers which the user will be able to click for easy use.

# features left to implement.
create links to full articles regarding events so that the user can read about the event in more detail.
